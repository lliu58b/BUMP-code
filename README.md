## about random python stuff

If you are using python, I recommed using a virtual environment
```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  (this command is linux/mac specific, idk bout the windows cmd)
```

Install the requirements specified in requirements.txt

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you `pip install` new libraries, please add it to the requirements.txt file by doing 
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

cheers
